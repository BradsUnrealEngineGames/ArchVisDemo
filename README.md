# ArchVisDemo

Here is a copy of my first project with Unreal 4, an archetectural visualization demo. Also provided are a few snapshots to geve a feel for the project. The other files here are the original non-generated files for the project, which must be used to rebuild generated content in order to run properly in the engine. Other files were excluded to limit repository size.
